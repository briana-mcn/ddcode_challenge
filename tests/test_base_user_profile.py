"""I would test the following for the UserProfile base class:

- `retrieved_data` keys and values are identical to the initial state
- `calculate_languages` method
    - test lower cases all languages in list and removes duplicates.
    - test it sets the associated `retrieved_data` key to a list object with those languages
    - test the correct count of languages
